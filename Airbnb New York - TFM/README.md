ABSTRACT:
In the last decade, the capacity to store and process data has boomed realated to everything seen previously, mainly because the general use of the internet, the reduction of storage costs and the appearance of new technologies capable of processing data. Despite this, data processing remains a key process because it is necessary to focus the data on real use cases that end up resulting in knowledge and added value. For this it is necessary to apply the key processes of data science: ETL (extraction, transformation and loading), exploratory analysis of data, the use of machine learning models and effective visualization of data. In this case, open data from the Airbnb platform will be used to make predictions and classifications, and discover what valuable information is hidden.
KEY WORDS: data science, machine learning, ETL, Python, Sklearn
