# FE_databanks
Each of the codes inside the folders follow the same process. First of all, get a new file to process, then compare its content to our 'masterfiles' (you can find it here `C:\...\Databanks`) where all the mapping is already done, make the proper calculations and cleaning of data and then upload it to a temporal table to compare it with the target table to be inserted to upload only the new values/data.


There are some differences between the different sources that are described inside each folder's repository.


There are some executables scripts in each folder that can be used by anyone in the team in oder to upload the latest file in our folders.
